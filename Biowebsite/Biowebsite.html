	<p style="font-size: 25px;">My name is Shelton Anderson. I was born July 1st 1996 at Bronx Lebenon Hospital in Bronx, Ny. Throughout my childhood i had a lot of dreams and wants. A lot of times I found myself trying to do everything all at once. I didn't really have a set interest until the day i got my first computer. Getting my first computer opened so many doors for me & had me wanting to learn every in & out about it. Throughout the first year of having my new computer i played,tweaked, & tried to figure out everything i could about that computer.<br> 
	As i got older i got new computers with more advanced features and started to spend more time outside which caused my interest for computers to slowly fade. Fast forwarded now im 20 years old and living life completely different. About 8 months ago i was in search of a program where i could obtain my HSE where i came across a great oppurtunity that could soon change the way i live. The program offered me a chance to obtain my HSE and also gave me the oppurtunity to be apart of a Web Development Program where i would attend a pre-trainning to learn the essentials of web development and coding to prepare us for the next big step which is going through the admissions process and being offered the oppurtunity to attend a boot camp where i will gain the experience and actually work hands on to prepare me to become a web developer myself. Being offered this oppurtunity is like reliving a huge childhood hobby all over again and being given the chance to actually make it in to the tech world this time.     </p>
